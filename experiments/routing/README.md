# Query-aware model routing

Standalone paper (separate from the PKPS paper; shares the `dkps` machinery
and the suites prepared in `examples/helm/`).

Route a new query to the model that best mimics a target model, using a
behavioral geometry localized to the query.

Given n models with cached responses to m anchor queries, and a new query q*,
model-model distances are the DKPS response distances with each anchor query's
contribution weighted by a query kernel k_Q(q_j, q*) — the PKPS product-kernel
construction, centered on the new query. We route q* to the candidate model
nearest the target model in this geometry. As the query-kernel bandwidth grows
the geometry collapses to static DKPS, so the method and the static baseline
live on one continuum.

## Evaluation (offline, cached responses)

For each held-out evaluation query and each target model, the routed model's
cached response is scored against the target's cached response in embedding
space ("mimicry error" — behavioral fidelity, not correctness):

    error(r; t, q*) = ||x_{r,q*} - x_{t,q*}||

**Leave-query-out, asserted in code:** no model's responses to an evaluation
query may enter any geometry, score estimate, or overlap index. Splits are
stratified by task; every table is bracketed by `random` and `oracle`
(hindsight-best — a floor for any router, inflated by extreme-value selection
when candidate pools are large).

Suites (loaded via `examples/helm/pipeline/loaders.py`; Gemini embeddings):

- **HELM paired core** — 93 models x 1529 queries (18 tasks), fully paired.
  The per-query pairwise squared-distance tensor P (m, n, n) is small (53 MB)
  and every weighted geometry — any bandwidth, static included — is a single
  tensordot over it.
- **EEE** — 45 models x 6808 queries (16 tasks), unpaired by construction
  (~10% incidental overlap). No paired tensor exists; the rank-one localized
  product kernel factorizes under a linear response kernel into distances
  between each model's k_Q(·,q*)-weighted mean of its OWN pool
  (`batched_localized_stats`) — no shared queries needed. Evaluation on
  queries with >= 3 responders.
- **Combined pool** — the union as ONE unlabeled task: 138 models, 8457
  queries, 34 hidden tasks; joint PCA of the shared raw query space;
  block-padded response spaces (within-suite errors unchanged).

Methods and baselines:

1. `qa-{f}x`   — nearest to target in the query-weighted geometry (RBF query
   kernel, sigma = f x median pairwise anchor-query distance; selectable
   leak-free by anchor pseudo-evaluation CV, `bandwidth_cv.py`)
2. `task*`     — nearest in the task-indicator geometry (uses hidden labels;
   reported as a reference ceiling, not a deployable router)
3. `static`    — nearest in the uniform-weight (static DKPS) geometry
4. `profile`   — score-profile routing: nearest per-task anchor score profile
   (the real no-embedding baseline — what a leaderboard alone can do)
5. `random` / `oracle` — brackets; the target itself is the metric's zero
6. tabular outcome-regression *ablation* (`run_helm_rf.py`, `rf-*` in
   `run_eee.py`): kernel regression of realized pairwise errors on the query
   embedding. Identical to `qa` on paired data by algebraic identity; starves
   on unpaired overlap. An estimation-structure ablation, not a baseline —
   its labels derive from response embeddings.

## Cost-aware offloading (the paper's economic frame)

`run_cost_routing.py`: flagship = anchor-best model; each router proposes a
substitute per query; size-capped candidate pools (name-parsed parameter
count as cost proxy). The setting is score-free: on real traffic no
per-query score exists (benchmarks are the exception), so the substitution
criterion is behavioral -- serve a cheap model whose responses stay within a
tolerance of the flagship's. Score retention is reported as a corollary,
measurable only on the benchmark testbed.

**Tolerance-gated offloading (headline).** The operator specifies a
deviation tolerance eps and a violation budget alpha; a query is offloaded
only when the router's expected deviation is within eps, with the
confidence cutoff chosen on a calibration split (held out of the geometry
like eval queries) so that P(dev > eps | offloaded) <= alpha
(`run_tolerance` / `conformal_gate` / `gap_close.py`). The contract holds
at every reported cell, and no score-free baseline can occupy ANY cell:
`lead` (serve the leaderboard-best cheap model) and `static` have constant
confidence, so their violation rate at a given eps is a fixed population
property (e.g. 45% at eps = 0.3) regardless of volume or budget. The
per-query contract requires a per-query error predictor.

**The confidence estimator ladder** (`gap_close.py`; contract (0.5, 10%),
combined pool, 15 seeds). A calibrated guarantee ALWAYS requires realized
deviations on a few hundred of the operator's own queries -- candidate
generations, bought with compute, no labels. The ladder prices what
pairing beyond that sample is worth:

| estimator | pairing assumed          | vol <=13B | vol all | viol | ret (all) |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------:|--------:|-----:|----------:|
| qa        | none (localized means)   |       18% |     28% |  ok  |     .984  |
| **pd-cal**| **calibration sample only** |   **36%** | **74%** | **.09** | **.995** |
| pairdev   | full suite pairing       |       24% |     70% |  ok  |     .986  |
| oracle    | (cheating reference)     |       83% |     95% |  --  |     .953  |

`pd-cal` regresses realized pairwise deviations on the calibration sample
itself (split in half: anchors / gate calibration, kept disjoint) and
BEATS full-suite pairing everywhere -- 400 anchors drawn from the
operator's own traffic are worth more than ~1400 suite-wide ones. Fully
unpaired estimators cannot close this gap in principle: the gated quantity
decomposes as ||mu_m - mu_f||^2 + tr S_m + tr S_f - 2 tr Cov(m, f), and
the co-movement term is a joint moment invisible to marginals (var-ub,
the Cov=0 bound, certifies ~0%; the same asymmetry as the score-agreement
side-study). Assumption box, final: no labels anywhere; candidate caches
may be pairwise disjoint; one ~400-query calibration sample, which any
calibrated policy needs and pd-cal simply does not waste.

**Aggregate curves (secondary).** At matched offload fractions, qa has the
lowest behavioral deviation among score-free policies everywhere (<=13B at
10/20/40/60% offload: .021/.049/.105/.177 vs lead .044/.083/.158/.238,
static .048/.090/.177/.254, random .050/.103/.198/.295) while holding
95-99% retention at conservative fractions. On raw score retention the
picture inverts and is reported honestly: `lead` ties or beats qa (a single
good model retains aggregate score without per-query intelligence), and
with dense on-distribution labels **qa-score** (localized score regression)
dominates all methods -- 60-70% offload at >=99% retention vs labeled
cascade's 30-40%. The score-scarcity sweep (`run_scarcity`) prices that
ceiling: at zero score coverage (cold-start candidates) qa-score and
cascade drop to random; ~1-3% coverage ties qa at moderate retention; the
>=99% frontier needs a fully scored cache.

Flagships: HELM `gemini-1.5-pro-002` (vs 8-9B substitutes: ~10-25x per-token
gap); EEE `gemini-3-1-pro-preview`, where modern small models sustain >=99%
retention only to ~10% offload -- the 2026 frontier gap is wider. With an
UNRESTRICTED pool there is no tradeoff at all: per-task specialists beat the
flagship (104.6% retention at full offload) -- there is no best model, only
best-per-task.

## Findings

1. **Label-free routing matches — and on the merged pool beats — task-labeled
   routing.** The kernel discovers task granularity and its soft boundaries
   with no metadata; merging heterogeneous caches costs nothing (the
   factorized geometry is per-model and cannot be cross-contaminated).
2. **Leaderboards cannot pick behavioral surrogates.** The score-profile
   baseline loses badly on both suites: models with similar score profiles do
   not behave similarly. Response-level information carries the entire gap.
3. **The pairing story replays at the routing level.** Paired, the qa
   geometry *is* kernel regression of squared mimicry error (verified
   identity); unpaired, per-pair regression starves (~27 shared anchors/pair)
   while the per-model factorization keeps the full gain.
4. **The oracle gap is structural, not tunable.** Task-mean error is the
   entire predictable component: after removing task means, error surfaces of
   embedding-adjacent queries are uncorrelated (~0.01 at every query
   dimension, 2 -> 3072). Bandwidth (flat optimum, CV lands on it), response
   dimension (8 -> full: 0.308 -> 0.301), and query dimension (low-d loses
   even with per-dimension bandwidths) are all saturated.
5. **Boundary of the factorization** (score-difference side-study): score
   *agreement* is irreducibly pairwise — E|Δs| depends on correctness
   co-occurrence that marginal means cannot express (Jensen) — so there the
   pair's historical disagreement rate routes best. Behavioral surrogacy
   factorizes; score-agreement surrogacy does not.
6. **Per-query contracts need per-query predictors.** Aggregate score
   retention is a coarse target a leaderboard pick can satisfy; a
   tolerance-with-budget contract (eps, alpha) cannot be occupied by any
   method whose confidence is constant across queries. The localized
   geometry is the only score-free per-query error predictor on the table,
   and its calibrated gate honors the contract on held-out traffic.

## Recommended configuration

Query dim 12–40 (PCA of the shared query space), one global sigma ~0.25x the
median anchor distance (or CV-selected), nearest-candidate pick. A full suite
evaluation runs in about a minute (batched per-model matmuls, validated to
<= 5e-5 against the reference implementation).

## Original scoping (jailbreak suite)

`data.py` / `embed_queries.py` / `precompute.py` / `run_eval.py` target the
jailbreak-dkps suite (82 models x 2666 attacks, nomic embeddings; data lives
on the a100 box). `geometry.py`, `router.py`, `evaluate.py` are
dataset-agnostic — a new paired suite needs only `X` (n, m, d) responses,
`query_emb` (m, d_q), and per-query `categories`.
